    <h2>Introduction to Paragraph Writing</h2>
    <p>
        ParagraphParagraphs are the group of sentences combined together, about a certain topic.<br>
        It is a very important form of writing as we write almost everything in paragraphs, be it an answer, essay, story, emails, etc. <br>
        We can say that a well-structured paragraph is the essence of good writing. The purposes of the paragraph are to give information, to explain something, to tell a story,<br>
        and to convince someone that our idea is right.<br>
    </p>
    <h2>
        Structure on paragraph.
        <ul>
            <li>Topic Sentence</li>
            <li>Supporting sentence</li>
            <li>Soncluding sentence</li>
        </ul>
    </h2>
    <ol type="1" start="1">
        <li>
            <h4>
                Topic Sentence
            </h4>
            <p>
                A topic sentence is a precise statement that reflects the main idea of the paragraph.<br>
                It should be carefully written as it will show the reader what you are going to talk about.<br> 
                Words chosen for this should not be cluttered and ambiguous as readers will decide to read further based on this.<br> 
                It is not necessary to write the topic sentence at the beginning of the paragraph. It can be put anywhere, as long as it reflects the main topic. For instance, <br>
                if you mention that you are going to talk about the advantages of using the hand sanitizer, then in supporting sentence you should only talk about advantages, not the features or anything else. <br>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Supporting Sentence</h4>
            <p>
                Supporting sentences explain the topic sentence in detail. <br>
                They expand the main topic and develops the main idea into the explanation. <br>
                They explain the main topic using examples, facts, quotes, etc. They have to be related to the topic sentence.<br>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
           <h4>
            Soncluding Sentence
           </h4>
           <p>
            A good concluding sentence brings a paragraph to a polished end. <br>
            It may give a summary of the main topic, a concluding sentence also gives a <br>
            final take on the topic and leaves the reader with complete information. <br>
           </p>
        </li>
